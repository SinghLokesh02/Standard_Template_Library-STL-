## Introduction

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks. This repository is designed to help you navigate and utilize the STL effectively.

## Getting Started

If you're new to C++ or need a refresher on STL basics, follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:SinghLokesh02/Standard_Template_Library-STL-.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: [`cd cpp-stl-concepts`](https://github.com/SinghLokesh02/Standard_Template_Library-STL-)
3. Explore the various directories, starting with `stl-containers`, `stl-algorithms`, and `stl-functions`.

## STL Containers

The `stl-containers` directory contains in-depth explanations and examples of various STL containers, including but not limited to:

- Vector
- List
- Stack
- Queue
- Map
- Set
- Array
- Priority Queue
- List
- Deque

Each container comes with its own set of explanations, use cases, and code samples to help you understand and apply these data structures in your C++ projects.

## STL Algorithms

The `stl-algorithms` directory focuses on essential algorithms provided by the STL, such as:

- Sorting
- Searching
- Transformations
- Accumulations
- and more...

Clear explanations and practical examples are provided to demonstrate how to use these algorithms effectively in your code.

## STL Functions

The `stl-functions` directory contains information about important STL functions that can be utilized in various scenarios, including:

- Lambda functions
- Predicate functions
- Comparison functions
- Hash functions

These functions play a crucial role in customizing the behavior of STL algorithms and containers.

## Usage

You can explore the concepts in any order you prefer, deepening your understanding of the C++ STL step by step. Each concept has its own dedicated directory with detailed explanations and well-commented code examples.

To compile and run the code examples, you can use a C++ compiler compatible with your system. Most examples are standalone and can be compiled individually.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute additional concepts, improve existing explanations, or fix errors, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix: `git checkout -b feature-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-name`.
5. Open a pull request, detailing your changes and their significance.

Let's work together to create a valuable resource for C++ developers exploring the STL!

Happy coding with C++ STL!
